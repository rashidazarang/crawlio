## The web wasn't built to be saved

Every website is a collection of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and fonts served from a remote server. You can view it — but you can't own it. Pages change, sites go offline, paywalls appear. The web you saw yesterday isn't guaranteed to be the web you see tomorrow.

Crawlio changes that.

## What Crawlio does

Crawlio is a native macOS app that downloads entire websites and saves them as local files on your disk. Not screenshots. Not PDFs. The actual HTML, CSS, images, fonts, and assets — with every link rewritten so you can browse the site offline exactly as it appeared online.

Paste a URL. Hit download. Walk away. When you come back, the entire site is sitting in a folder on your Mac.

## Why local files matter now

The rise of AI tools like Claude, ChatGPT, and Cursor has created an entirely new use case for downloaded websites. These tools are brilliant at reading and understanding files — but they can't browse the live web the way you can.

Download a site with Crawlio, open the folder in your IDE, and your AI reads the actual source code. Not a summary. Not a screenshot. The real HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This is the workflow:

1. **Download** — Crawlio grabs the full site
2. **Open** — Point your AI at the files
3. **Build** — Your AI reads the real source and builds from it

See a design you like? Download it. Ask your AI to rebuild the hero section in React. It reads the actual CSS values — the real spacing, the true typography, the exact colors.

## Built for macOS

Crawlio is a native Swift app. No Electron. No browser wrapper. Pure SwiftUI with async/await concurrency. It starts instantly, uses minimal memory, and feels like it belongs on your Mac.

Six content parsers handle HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PDFs, sitemaps, and robots.txt. Four export formats — Folder, ZIP, WARC, and Single File — cover everything from casual browsing to ISO 28500 digital preservation.

## Privacy by design

Zero telemetry. Zero analytics. No accounts. No cloud. Everything runs locally on your Mac. We don't know what sites you download, and we don't want to know.

## Get started

Download Crawlio, paste a URL, and hit start. Your first website archive will be ready in minutes.
